## Steps and Implementation

### 1. Resource Group Setup

- **Task:** Created a resource group named `FlipkartDataProjectRG` to manage and organize all Azure resources for this project.
  
### 2. Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)

- **Task:** Set up an ADLS Gen2 account (`flipkartdatalake`) and created a `rawdata` container to store the original dataset for further processing.
- **Steps:**
  - Uploaded the dataset to the raw data container in ADLS for centralized storage.

### 3. Azure Data Factory (ADF)

- **Task:** Created an Azure Data Factory instance (`flipkartdatafactory`) to develop data pipelines for ingesting and transforming data.
- **Steps:**
  - Developed pipelines to copy data from ADLS to Azure SQL Database.
  - Set up a pipeline for data transformation using Databricks (optional).
